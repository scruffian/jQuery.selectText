# jQuery.selectText

### Usage

* Any elements with the class "selectText" will be picked up by the plugin automatically. They will select the elements that are matched by the selector in the "href" attribute, if it has one, or the "data-target-selector" attribute otherwise.

* If you want to select the text in an element simply call $(selector).selectText();

### Notes

* Only 705 bytes!

### Limitations / TODO

* Not tested in any browser except Chrome (although it should work for all of them)

* Can only select one element at a time
